Simple Anki addon for some custom AI prompts I use.

- Provides a framework of functions to use for adding new prompts.
- Prompts are available in right-click menu of notes in Anki's card browser

Prompts:

- `clean_meaning`: Automatically reduce a full jp dictionary entry gotten from MDX dictionaries into just the part that pertains to the specific example sentence used for the word.
  - Also generates new meanings when no dict entry is present. Applied on adding new notes, so I used it often. Intended to be used with a deck structure where you have multiple notes for different meanings of a word which each contains an example sentence for that particular meaning.
  - Also will update all meanings of the word, if there are multiple, using the dictionary entry looked up from the MDX dictionaries.
- `translate_field`: Translate a field from Japanese to English. Used rarely, since I mostly mine from anime and get the translation from the english subs.
- `make_kanji_story`: Write a mnemonic story for the components a kanji is written with, in Japanese. Used daily on new kanji drawing practice notes. Expects a JSON file `_kanji_story_component_words.json` to exist and be a simple dict of component phrases.
- `kanjify_sentence`: Take a furigana format sentence and kanjify each hiragana/katakana word if there's some valid kanji form for it. The kanjified words are wrapped with `<k>` tags
- `extract_words`: Extract individual words from the kanjified sentence, grouped by their part of speech. Writes a json object with arrays of words into the note.
- `match_words_to_notes`: Match the extracted words in the list to an existing word note, using the word's meaning. If matching isn't possible, creates a new word note and comes up with a meaning that matches the usage of the word in the sentence.

## Installing dependencies

First install mdict-query manually from GitHub (repo has no setup.py):

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
cd lib
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path mdict_query
cd mdict_query
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/mdict_query.py" -OutFile "__init__.py"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/readmdict.py" -OutFile "readmdict.py"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/ripemd128.py" -OutFile "ripemd128.py"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/pureSalsa20.py" -OutFile "pureSalsa20.py"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/lzo.py" -OutFile "lzo.py"
cd ..\..
```

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
cd lib
mkdir -p mdict_query
cd mdict_query
curl -o __init__.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/mdict_query.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/readmdict.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/ripemd128.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/pureSalsa20.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjang/mdict-query/master/lzo.py
cd ../..
```

Then install other dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade -t lib --no-cache-dir --python-version 3.9 --only-binary=:all: -r requirements.txt
```
