Selection criteria:
- DO NOT overfit the definition to the sentence{'s' if len(sentences) > 1 else ''}, but rather pick as many meanings as possible that can broadly fit the theme of the sentence{'s' if len(sentences) > 1 else ''}.
- Figurative uses of literal meanings should be one definition: When there is a pair of meanings for this word or phrase, one literal and one figurative, always pick both and shorten their respective descriptions. Do this even if the sentence{'s' if len(sentences) > 1 else ''} only uses one of the meanings.
- In case there is only a single meaning, return that.

Omission rules:
- Omit any example sentences the matching meaning(s) included (often included within 「」 brackets).
- Descriptions of animals and plants are often scientific. From these omit descriptions on their ecology and only describe their appearance and type of plant/animal with simple language.

Simplification rules:
- YOU MUST Shorten and simplify the meaning as much as possible, ideally into 1 sentence and at most 2 (if describing both a literal and figurative usage), with more complex meanings being allowed more explanation.

Formatting rules:
- Clean off meaning numberings and other notation leaving only a plain text description.

Additionally, but only if it seems necessary, reword the English dictionary definition to fit the Japanese one. The English definition should ideally simply list equivalent words, if there are some, and only explain in sentences when it's necessary.

Return a JSON object with two fields:
Return the extracted and possibly modified Japanese meaning as the value of the key "{jp_meaning_return_field}".
Return the possibly modified English meaning as the value of the key "{en_meaning_return_field}".
